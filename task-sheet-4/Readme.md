    Write a program that demonstrates type conversion between int,
    loat64, and string. Convert an integer to a float64, a float64 to an
    integer, and an integer to a string. Print the results.

**operations.go**

    Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division) on integer and float64 variables.
    Print the results.

**const.go**

    Write a program that defines constants for mathematical values like Pi
    and the gravitational constant. Print these constants.

**varinf.go**

    Write a program that uses type inference and short variable declaration
    to initialise variables. Print the values of these variables.

**var.go**

    Write a program that declares and initialises variables of different data
    types (int, float64, string, bool). Print the values of these variables.

[task-sheet-2]:

**FizzBuzz.go**

    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For
    multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of
    five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print
    "FizzBuzz".

**primeNumber.go**

    Write a program that finds and prints all the prime numbers up to
    100.

**sumOfDigitOfNum.go**

    Write a program that takes an integer and returns the sum of its
    digits.

**fibonacci.go**

    Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the n-th
    Fibonacci number. Use recursion and memoization.

**factorial.go**

    Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the factorial
    of n. Implement both iterative and recursive versions.

**palnidrome.go**

    Write a function that takes a string and returns true if the string is
    a palindrome, and false otherwise.

**collatzConjecture.go**
    Write a program that takes a number n and returns the number of
    steps to reach 1 by following these rules: if n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd,
    multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**sumOfMultiples.go**

    Write a program that finds the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below
    1000.

**GCD.go**

    Write a function that takes two integers and returns their greatest
    common divisor using Euclidean algorithm.

**Anagrams.go**

    Write a function that takes two strings and returns true if they are
    anagrams of each other.

**GuessNum.go**

    Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and
    100. The user has to guess the number. After each guess, the program should
    indicate whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. Limit the number
    of guesses to 10.

[task-sheet-3]:

**arrRotate.go**

    Write a function that rotates an array to the right by k steps.

**medianArr.go**

    Write a function that finds the median of a given array.

**wordFq.go**

    Write a function that finds the median of a given array.

**anagramGrouping.go**

    Write a function that takes a list of strings and groups anagrams.
    together in a map.

**empID.go**

    Define a struct to represent an employee with fields for ID, name,
    position, and salary. Write functions to create a new employee, give a raise,
    and display employee details.

**libSys.go**

    Create a struct to represent a book with fields for title, author,
    ISBN, and whether it's available. Write functions to add a new book, borrow a
    book, return a book, and display book details.

**swapVar.go**

    Write a function that swaps the values of two variables using
    pointers.

**pointerToStruct.go**

    Define a struct to represent a rectangle with length and width.
    Write functions to calculate the area and perimeter using a pointer to the
    struct.

**linkedList.go**

    Implement a simple linked list using structs and pointers. Include
    methods for adding a node to the list, deleting a node, and displaying the list.

**linkedListGeneric.go**

     Implement a simple linked list using structs and pointers. Include
    methods for adding a node to the list, deleting a node, and displaying the list.
    [linked list while using generic types]

**fileReaderHandling.go**

    Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents. Ensure
    the program handles errors appropriately, such as when the file does not exist
    or cannot be opened.

**httpErrHandle.go**

    Write a program that makes an HTTP GET request to a specified
    URL and prints the response body. Ensure the program handles errors, such as
    network issues or non-200 status codes

**modifySliceptr.go**

    Write a function that takes a pointer to a slice and modifies its
    elements.

    that parses an integer from a string.

**expoBackoff.go**

    Write a function that retries an operation (e.g., an HTTP request)
